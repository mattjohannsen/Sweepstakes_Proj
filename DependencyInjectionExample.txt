Dependency Injection
I use Dependency Injection in my Sweepstakes project by first creating a DEPENDENCY. Both of my classes SweepStackManager and SweepstakeQueueManager are dependent upon the ISweepStakesManager interface.  This means that there is a contract between the classes and the interface that both classes contain the InsertSweepstakes method and the GetSweepstakes method.  I created a variable "manager" which is of type ISweepStakesManager.  This means this variable can either be of type SweepstakeStackManager or SweepstakesQueueManager or any other future class that is dependent upon the ISweepStakesManager interface. I then INJECT this dependency into instantiation of the MarketingFirm theFirm at the end of the CreateMarketingFirmWithManager method in the Simulation class.
